              We built a benchmark of mathematically grounded textual games. For each game, a model gets 30 tries. After each try, it gets a score. The core test is how effectively it uses the history of its scores to make better attempts. This measures meta-learning and reasoning, not just raw knowledge.

              <span className="font-semibold">Scoring:</span> The score is a measure of how much more likely the judge is to predict the text given the prefix than without. It's measured in logits (logarithms of probability) and is the sum for every token of the logits gained (or lost) by prepending the prefix.
